# Setting up

In short, install [Red Hat OpenShift Local](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers).

## System Prerequisites

- Any modern CPU, incl. Apple Silicon, with a few cores available
- ~10GB+ RAM
- 40GB+ storage

## Installation 

1. Get a Red Hat account
2. Download the installer in [RH's developer console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned?intcmp=7013a000002CtetAAC)
3. Download the pull secrets just below, these will be used for authentication purposes later
4. Run the installer - *you will need elevated permissions for this!*
5. Set up the runtime in a terminal (this will include *downloading about 5GB of data*), see [Using OpenShift Local](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_local/2.33/html/getting_started_guide/using). It is also recommended to increase the allocated RAM before creating. 
    ```bash
    crc config set memory 16000
    crc setup
    ```

*Note: You may need to recreate the whole virtual machine if you decide to change these resources later.*

## Starting

To authenticate your cluster against Red Hats container registry, start it pointing at the pull secrets you obtained before:

```bash
crc start -p ~/Downloads/pull-secret
```

<summary>Troubleshooting Windows ðŸªŸ</summary>
#### âš¡Issue: Windows user not part of Hyper-V Administrators

To determine which users are members of the "Hyper-V Administrators" group, execute the following command:
```PowerShell
Get-LocalGroupMember -Group "Hyper-V Administrators"
```
To add the current user to this group, use the following command (Suggestions: restart the computer afterwards):
```PowerShell
([adsi]"WinNT://./Hyper-V Administrators,group").Add("WinNT://$env:UserDomain/$env:Username,user")
```

#### âš¡Issue: Port 80 is blocked
To identify the process using port 80, execute the following command:
```PowerShell
netstat -aon | findStr /i "LISTENING" | findStr ":80"
```
If the process has PID 4, it indicates that the system is using it, possibly due to the HTTP service running. To temporarily stop the HTTP service, use:
```PowerShell
net stop http /y
```
Note that the service may restart automatically. To permanently disable it, set the Registry key at Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP from 3 to 4 (disabled).

#### âš¡Issue: Running a VPN client
When starting crc, access to the hosts file is necessary. Some VPN clients may restrict access to this file. Either disable this restriction within the VPN client's settings or terminate the client temporarily.

## Configuration

You may check or change configuration of cluster configuration params:

```bash
crc config view
```

```bash
crc config set consent-telemetry no
```
